# Mini Social Media App

A simple social media-style application built with React to practice core
frontend concepts and component-based architecture.

## Features
- Create post
- Like post
- Comment on posts
- Delete posts
- Simple login (name-based)

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- Vite

## Design Decisions
This project is intentionally kept simple and open to focus on learning React
fundamentals instead of complex business rules.

- Open social feed: any user can create, like, comment, and delete posts.
- No strict ownership rules for posts.
- No global state management (Redux) in this version.
- No real authentication; login is UI-focused.

## Learning Goals
- Component separation
- State lifting and props
- Form handling
- Local state management with `useState`
- Building real-world UI features step by step

## Future Improvements
- Proper authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Global state management (Redux)
- Backend API integration
